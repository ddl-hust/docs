Chainbase is building an crypto world model, Theia, which is designed to learn blockchain data and realize simulation and reasoning of the native blockchain environment. Agents built based on it can effectively understand, predict and interact with the blockchain.

Chainbase assembled a team led by a professor in the field of AI to build the model to support native crypto applications, including AI crypto games, DeFi, security, social, asset management, and more.

## What is Crypto World Model?

The crypto world is built on massive and rapidly growing blockchain data, which contains an abundance of knowledge and underlying opportunities. Chainbase continually extracts, records, and organizes this data, summarizing it for downstream users. However, a significant and persistent challenge is that the vast "dark knowledge" within crypto data cannot be effectively organized solely through traditional databases and limited human effort. Accessing and interpreting this knowledge easily and conveniently remains a challenge for crypto participants.
